# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Usage

The OpenAPI Analyzer GitHub Action is designed with privacy and transparency in mind. This document explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your rights.

---

### What We Collect
- **OpenAPI Specification URLs**: Required to run the analysis.  
- **Analysis Results**: Suggestions, validations, and quality checks generated from your OpenAPI spec.  
- **User Metadata**:
  - GitHub username and repository information  
  - Action execution frequency and usage patterns  
  - Performance metrics from analysis runs  
  - Contact details (if provided for support purposes)  

---

### Why We Collect Data
We only collect data that is necessary to provide, improve, and support the service:  

- **OpenAPI Specification URLs** – so the action can fetch and analyze your API specification.  
- **Analysis Results** – to deliver actionable feedback, generate reports, and improve validation accuracy.  
- **GitHub Metadata (username, repo info)** – to identify usage context, improve integration, and enable support.  
- **Usage Patterns and Performance Metrics** – to optimize performance, scale the service, and detect failures.  
- **Contact Information** – so we can respond to your requests and provide customer support.  

We do **not** use collected data for advertising or unrelated purposes.  

---

### What We *Do Not* Collect
- ❌ **API Keys or Secrets** – no access to authentication credentials.  
- ❌ **Passwords or Tokens** – we never collect sensitive credentials.  
- ❌ **Private Repository Content** – unless explicitly provided by you.

### How We Process Data
- **Local Analysis**: Specs are analyzed in the GitHub Actions runner.  
- **Data Transmission**: Analysis results and metadata are securely transmitted to our servers.  
- **Data Storage**: We store collected data for:  
  - Service reliability and optimization  
  - Usage analytics and product insights  
  - Support and customer service  
  - Feature development and improvements  

---

### Security
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All transmitted data is encrypted.  
- **Secure Storage**: User data and analysis results are stored on secure servers.  
- **Limited Sharing**: We may share *anonymized* insights with trusted partners for research and improvement—never personal or sensitive data.  

---

### GitHub Actions Environment
- All processing runs inside GitHub’s secure infrastructure.  
- Data handling is subject to GitHub’s own [privacy and security policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy).  
- Analysis results are available both in your workflow logs and on our servers.

### Data Retention
- **User Metadata**: Retained up to **2 years** or until deletion is requested.  
- **Analysis Results**: Retained up to **1 year** for service improvement.  
- **Usage Analytics**: Retained up to **3 years** for long-term product insights.
