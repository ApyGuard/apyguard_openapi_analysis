# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection and Usage

The OpenAPI Analyzer GitHub Action is designed with privacy in mind. Here's how we handle data:

### What We Collect
- **OpenAPI Specification URLs**: The action requires a URL to your OpenAPI specification
- **Analysis Results**: The action analyzes your OpenAPI spec and generates suggestions

### What We DON'T Collect
- ❌ **No Personal Data**: We do not collect any personal information
- ❌ **No API Keys**: We do not store or transmit any API keys or credentials
- ❌ **No User Data**: We do not collect user information or usage patterns
- ❌ **No Persistent Storage**: All analysis is performed in-memory and results are only output to your workflow

### Data Processing
- **Local Processing**: All analysis is performed locally within the GitHub Actions runner
- **No External Services**: The action does not send data to external services
- **No Logging**: We do not log or store analysis results
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or tracking is performed

### Data Transmission
- **HTTPS Only**: All network requests use HTTPS encryption
- **No Data Storage**: Analysis results are only output to your workflow logs
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not share data with third parties

### GitHub Actions Environment
This action runs within the GitHub Actions environment, which means:
- All processing happens within GitHub's secure infrastructure
- Data is subject to GitHub's privacy policies and security measures
- No data leaves the GitHub Actions runner environment

### Your Control
- **Full Control**: You control what OpenAPI specs to analyze
- **Local Results**: All results are output to your workflow and remain in your control
- **No Data Retention**: We do not retain any data after the action completes
